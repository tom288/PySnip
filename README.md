PySnip is a server for the non-steam games 'Ace of Spades' and 'OpenSpades' available from [here](https://www.buildandshoot.com/download/). These are server plugins:

# day.py
> Day night cycle implemented using continuous changes to the fog  
> Fully compatible with disco  
> RGB interpolation is used, which is ugly if the night sky is not black  


# medic.py
> Shotgun users can heal teammates with their spades  
> One possible improvement could be to double healing done to crouching players
